# Programming With Purpose

This repository contains solutions and code developed as part of the "Programming With Purpose" course, based on the curriculum from Princeton University. The course introduces fundamental concepts in computer science and programming using the Java language.

## About the Course
"Programming With Purpose" is designed to teach the basics of programming, computational thinking, and problem-solving. The course covers topics such as:

- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (conditionals and loops)
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays and data structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Basic algorithms and applications

The course emphasizes writing clear, efficient, and correct code, and encourages students to develop strong analytical and logical reasoning skills.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Contains Java source files for various assignments and exercises.
- `graderFeedback/`: Contains feedback files (e.g., PDFs) received from the automated grading platform.

## Testing and Grading
All code in this repository was tested and graded by an external automated platform provided by the course. The test cases and grading scripts were not made available to students; only the results and feedback were provided after submission. Feedback files (such as PDFs) are included in the `graderFeedback/` directory for reference.

## Getting Started
To run the code examples and assignments, you will need:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE or command-line tools

Compile and run Java files from the `src/` directory as needed.

## Credits
This repository is inspired by the course materials from Princeton University and the book "Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
